# RockPaperScissorsProject
A simple Rock Paper Scissors game for my CST studio project

This was a project done in CMST studio II class. The object of the project was to explore node, nodemon, learn about sockets and server connections.
Currently this project allows you to connect networked computers together via ip/port addressing on the same network and allows 2 players to play a simple game of Rock Paper Scissors.

Challenges included: learning the functions and how functions call other functions. Socket codes liek new.socket emit.socket. Much of this is still a working learning process thank you for all you support and feedback! o7
